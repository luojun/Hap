 * Created by Jun Luo on 13-12-02.
 *
 * This is meant to be a generic AUI (Auditory UI) class that corresponds to View in GUI. "Endu"
 * is so called because the word "view" is derived from the (old) French word for "seen" and
 * the French word for "heard" is "entendu".
 *
 * The corresponding class for Window will be called "Windah", where "ah" is the first two letters
 * of the word Ahre, for "ear". Etymologically, "Window" means "wind-eye".
